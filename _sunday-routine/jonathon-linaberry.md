<h4>**Jonathon Linaberry is [The Bones of JR Jones](http://thebonesofjrjones.bandcamp.com/)- bartender by day, foot-stompin' troubador by night. Find him on stage or on the subway platform, seated behind a kick drum and a hands-free harmonica. Sometimes, he's wearing a top hat. On Sundays, he can be found in his Greenpoint apartment eating Grape Nuts with his girlfriend.**</h4>Born and raised in central New York, in a house at the end of a long dirt road, J.R. started dabbling in music at a young age when his mother mandated that he take piano lessons. He's a self-taught banjo and guitar player, with a sound clearly evolved from his record collection: old gospel hymns, bluesmen like R.I. Burnside, and artists like The Carter Family and Tom Waits. The sound's been best described as “haunting...stomp blues tempered with a touch of honey.” Like his music, J.R.'s Sunday Routine involves a strong attachment to sensory experiences and an appreciation for home. Sunday is a day he says, where we find folks at their most honest.
