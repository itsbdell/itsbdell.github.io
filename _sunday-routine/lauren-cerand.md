<h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1401631778721_26171">Who are you? What do you do?</h2>
Oh, I'm just a little girl from Little Rock, as they say. Today on Broad Street, while I was out for a walk, a woman asked me if I was from here, and I thought, as I always do, "No, I'm from somewhere else." But the truth is, I've lived in Manhattan all my adult life and she just wanted directions to the Wall Street Bull (which, is, in fact, on Broadway, just North of Bowling Green–– can't miss it, and keep an eye out for a Peregrine Falcon, soaring or perhaps perched somewhere above the original Colonial-era fence).
