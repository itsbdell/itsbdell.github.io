## Hi Hannah! Tell us about you.

A few years ago, I founded [Sweets & Bitters](http://sweetsandbitters.com/), which started as a blog and a series of mini-cookbooks (there are events now too), because I wanted to teach people to make beautiful food for real life. A lot of food media is so aspirational that it's inaccessible, and I want to show people things they feel like they could really do, without dumbing it down. I do a lot of the same kinds of work––food styling, writing, and recipe development––as a freelancer. <span>I'm almost thirty, and starting to find my way with work. </span>
