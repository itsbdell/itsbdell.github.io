## <span>Who are you? What do you do for a living?</span>

[JK Keller](http://jk-keller.com/) ⇉ Jonathan Keller Keller. I suffer from [RAS Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome), like an ATM machine or the HIV virus. I live in I ♥ NY with my wife, Keetra Dean Dixon, and our pups, Frankie & Tilda. I make most of my $$$$$ as a web developer/designer at a large foundation. A small portion of my ¢¢ comes from artworks & commissions completed in my off-hours, commonly referred to as “free time,” though I’ve always thought it most precious.
