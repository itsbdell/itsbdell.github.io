<h2 style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Who are you? What do you do for a living?</h2>My name is Tom Mylan. I'm a 37 year old male from southern California living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I'm a butcher by trade and the Executive Butcher and co-owner of the [Meat Hook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Meat-Hook/177417581102), a butcher shop specializing in local, sustainably raised meat. I'm also the author of the *Meat Hook Meat Book* that will be released by Artisan publishing in May of 2014.
