<div class="intro">

I'm based in Brooklyn, NY. I help big companies grapple with the future, and startups grapple with the present, primarily through standing up new strategies and capabilities - like innovation, incubation and accelerator programs.

## Now

- I lead the Future of Home group at the [Lowe’s Innovation Labs](https://www.lowesinnovationlabs.com/), exploring emerging home data possibilities
- Prior to joining Lowe's, I led the [Tachyon Accelerator](https://labs.consensys.net/tachyon/) at [ConsenSys Labs](https://labs.consensys.net/), focused on blockchain and web 3.0 startups
- And before that, I worked on the revenue side at [Quartz](https://qz.com/) helping launch [Quartz Creative](https://creative.qz.com/), and was a partner at [GMD studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMD_Studios), a ventures & innovation firm

I try to memorize a poem each week, go for runs, and write about organizational change stuff at [Little Futures](https://littlefutures.substack.com/).

I like this [idea of research](https://sterneworks.org/) and strategy:

> “serious research leads one to unite what is ordinarily separated or to distinguish what is ordinarily confused.”
