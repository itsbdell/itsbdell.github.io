## Hi, I'm Brian I'm based in Brooklyn, NY. I help big companies grapple with
the future, and startups grapple with the present, primarily through standing up
new strategies and capabilities - like innovation, incubation and accelerator
programs. Get in touch: [dell.brian@gmail.com](mailto:dell.brian@gmail.com) /
[@itsbdell](https://twitter.com/itsbdell) /
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianjdell/) ## Now - I lead the Future
of Home group at the [Lowe’s Innovation
Labs](https://www.lowesinnovationlabs.com/), exploring emerging home data
possibilities - Prior to joining Lowe's, I led the [Tachyon
Accelerator](https://labs.consensys.net/tachyon/) at [ConsenSys
Labs](https://labs.consensys.net/), focused on blockchain and web 3.0 startups -
And before that, I worked on the revenue side at [Quartz](https://qz.com/)
helping launch [Quartz Creative](https://creative.qz.com/), and was a partner at
[GMD studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMD_Studios), a ventures &
innovation firm I try to memorize a poem each week, go for runs, and write about
organizational change stuff at [Little
Futures](https://littlefutures.substack.com/). I like this [idea of
research](https://sterneworks.org/) and strategy: > “serious research leads one
to unite what is ordinarily separated or to distinguish what is ordinarily
confused.”
