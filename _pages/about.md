Hi, I'm Brian. 

I help big companies grapple with the future, and startups grapple with the present, primarily through standing up new strategies and capabilities - like innovation, incubation and accelerator programs.

* I am currently working on emerging home data possibilities at [Lowe’s Innovation Labs](https://www.lowesinnovationlabs.com/), the applied R&D function at Lowe's
* Prior to joining Lowe's, I led the [Tachyon Accelerator](https://labs.consensys.net/tachyon/) at [ConsenSys Labs](https://labs.consensys.net/), focused on blockchain and web 3.0 startups
* And before that, I worked on the revenue side at [Quartz](https://qz.com/) helping launch [Quartz Creative](https://creative.qz.com/), and was a partner at [GMD studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMD_Studios), a ventures & innovation firm

I try to memorize a poem each week, go for runs, and write about organizational change stuff at [Little Futures](https://littlefutures.substack.com/).  

I like this [idea of research](https://sterneworks.org/) and strategy: 
> “serious research leads one to unite what is ordinarily separated or to distinguish what is ordinarily confused.”

If you'd like to meet, I'd probably like to meet you. Feel free to get in touch!
